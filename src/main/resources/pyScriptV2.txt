This function runs provided Python code to obtain desired results.
The code must conform to Python version 2 syntax.
The code must have single top level function called "script" which takes single parameter.

The function parameter is an object with the following type:
    class PyScriptApi:
        """This class has various methods to call external services."""
        def localDateTime(self):
            """The method returns current local date and time as a string, e.g. 'Tue, 3 Jun 2008 11:05:30'"""
            // Implementation details is omitted
            pass
        def webSearch(self, query, start = 1, count = 10, site = ""):
            """The methon runs web search. Parameters are:
                   * query - search string,
                   * start - position of the first result to return,
                   * count - number of results to return,
                   * site - search domain restriction, empty string means global search without restrictions.
               Search results are list where each item is a dictionary describing search results."""
            // Implementation details is omitted
            pass

The Python "script" function must return single value of the following types: boolean, integer, float, string, list, dictionary, or their combinations.
The dictionary keys must be always strings, the dictionary values can be any type of the above.
The result Python value will be converted into JSON value using corresponding JSON types: dictionary will be mapped into JSON object, list will be mapped into JSON array.
Python string, integer, float, and boolean values will be converted into corresponding JSON types.

For example, to calculate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers the Python code should look like this:
def script(api):
    """
    Returns a list containing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using Python 2 syntax.
    """
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(10):
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return result

For example, to obtain current local date and time the Python code should look like this:
def script(api):
    return api.localDateTime()

For example, to get current day of the week the Python code should look like this:
def script(api):
    return api.localDateTime()[0:3]

For example, to get current year the Python code should look like this:
def script(api):
    return api.localDateTime().split(' ')[3]

For example, to get the first snippet about Buick cars from Wikipedia website the Python code should look like this:
def script(api):
    results = api.webSearch("Buick", site="wikipedia.org")
    if len(results) < 1:
            raise RuntimeError("No search results")
    return results[0]["snippet"]
